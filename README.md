### PACKAGING LIST: ###

 LearnMath :-

 This app implements the Learn Math method. There are three phases: 
 
   * Learn the Math
   * Apply the Math
   * Drill 
	
 Each phase has separate exercises. 
 
   * Swipe left and right to move between exercises. 
   * Within an exercise, swipe up and down to change operators.
   * Info buttons on each page will help to guide you.

 ApplyMath:-

   * After learning new Learn math we apply them solving problems. This embeds them into our memory.
   * Follow the Facts -> Application -> Drill sequence. For addition and multiplication problems the "carry" function is handled             much the same way you would do it on paper.  
   * Just enter the correct sequence of digits. Regrouping in subtraction is similar. Just enter the correct sequence of digits.

 
 LongDivision:-

   * Enter digits in the proper sequence. No short cuts are allowed. Remember to provide remainders as needed.

 Drill:-

   * Solve the problems in this Drill as quickly as you can. Beat the timer and count of questions set in the Menu Options to "win". 
   * Practicing with Drill builds 'automaticity' - the ability to just know the answer without having to think about it.

Settings:-

   * Setting will help to select the arithmetic operators, level of difficulty, drill time and number of questions to practice.
